When a user enters the website, they are able to sign in or create an account through the login portal. If there were entries in the database, the user would have been greeted with said entries.
Next steps would be to clean up the UI and add entries to the database to have a more welcoming user experience.

NOTE: After reading through the important notice before the submit box, I should state that I have used many resources to come to this final product. Unfortunately many of the links are lost or forgotten due to the large timeframe in which I had been working on the project. I apologize for any inconvenience or problems this may cause.
